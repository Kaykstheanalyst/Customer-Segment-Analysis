## Overview
I conducted a comprehensive customer segment analysis to help Edge Store optimize product offerings and sales strategies. Analyzing age group preferences, seasonal sales trends, and country-specific buying behaviors to drive revenue growth. Recommendations include expanding products for teenagers, investigating 2021 sales decline, increasing accessory variety, and replicating successful strategies across countries.

## Business Questions
### Expanding Product Offerings Age groups
What products are currently available that target the teenagers and children market?
How can the product range be expanded to better appeal to this demographic?

### Investigating Sales Trend
What factors could have contributed to the decline in sales during this period in 2021?
How can these factors be addressed to prevent future declines?

### Increasing Availability of Certain Product Category
What are the top-selling accessories currently available?
How can the variety of products in the accessories category be increased to meet demand?

### Replicating Successful Sales Strategies Across Countries
What specific strategies have contributed to high sales in the United States?
How can these strategies be replicated in other countries, such as France, to increase sales?

## Analysis Findings and Recommendations
The segmentation by age group chart shows that a larger percentage of the customers are middle aged ranging from 25-34 years and 34 - 64, this is quite impressive and also the age group contribution to revenue also reveals the same thing. However, products that appeals tho those below 25 can also be included in stock especially products that are meant to target the teenagers and children market

- The seasonal sales trend shows that sales as compared to the previous four years has been on the rise consistently, which was also revealed in the running total revenue trend, but in 2021 from the month of July to November the sales has nose-dived which really need to be investigated as the trend is not consistent with the previous years

- The dashboard also shows that customers have consistently been buying products in the accessories category more than others. varieties of products in this category can be made more available as the demand has consistently been good.

- A larger percentage of the customers come from the united states and the dashboard also reveals that they prefer making their purchase on Sundays, this can be employed in improving sales in France and also United States should be looked into and the measures that are responsible for high sales recorded can also be replicated across other countries

- The dashboard also reveals that the adults and young adults have the greatest customer lifetime value and a great level of loyalty. This is highly commendable and probably it might be as a result of products that resonates with their age group, the product category can be expanded to accommodate other age categories.
